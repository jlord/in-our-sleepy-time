I would like you to create a static GitHub Page site which presents a random episode of the BBC podcast "In Our Time".

The RSS feed for the podcast is available here: https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/b006qykl.rss

Since the site is static a random episode is chosen by running a GitHub Action (GHA).

The site should contain two buttons, one to download the mp3 directly and one to open
the episode in the Apple Podcasts app.

This GHA will run daily at 5am UTC using a cron timer.


This action performs the following:
- It creates an empty `played.txt` file if that file doesn't already exist
- It pulls the lastest RSS feed from the link above
- It parses the RSS XML to find the links to the episodes, there should be over 1000
- It loads the `played.txt` file which contains new line delimited links to podcast episodes
- It filters out the episode links in `played.txt` from the RSS XML list of links
- It picks one link at random from the filtered list, this is the selected podcast
- It adds the selected podcast's link to a new line in `played.txt`
- It builds a static HTML site that just displays the link to the selected podcast
- It commits these changes to the repo with the comment "Daily podcast update"


The core logic should be implented as a Node.js app in a file called `update.js`.

Please include setup instructions in a file called `README.md`
